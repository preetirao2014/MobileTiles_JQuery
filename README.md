## About the app

- The app is merely to demonstrate asynchronous functionality. 
- Clicking the settings icon on the top right also takes you to a list view page
- The List view page allows toggling of checkboxes to control the image tiles that can be seen. 
- The list view also allows the rearranging of the order of the list items using the hamburger icons on the right. This controls the order in which we see the image tiles.
